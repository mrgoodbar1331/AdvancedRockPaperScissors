Advanced Rock Paper Scissors README

Alright. If you've made it this far, then you've done most of the hard stuff.

This is Rock Paper Scissors, but instead of entering in either Rock Paper Scissors,
the user enters 1 of 3 keywords that are specified before the game starts.

If a user enters a keyword that is not one of the 3, then the game will randomly select
a result for the round. The game will only do this 3 times for a player, afterwards
the player automatically loses the round.

At the end of each round the game will give an option to rotate the keywords.
I.E. if you specified "superman" to be rock, then "superman" will represent
paper after the rotation.

These rules are described in the game as well, and it should be clear what do do
at every point. It's 2-player, so find a friend!
